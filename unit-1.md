# Unit 1

## 1.1

Here's a basic Java program called "MyClass.java":

```java
// Single line comment

/*
 * Multi line
 * comment
 */

public class MyClass { // Class must be same name as file (MyClass.java)
    
    public static void main(String[] args) { // Main method, program runs here
        
        // System.out is an object used to display text in the console

        System.out.print("How "); // Prints text to console but doesn't move cursor to next line
        System.out.print("are ");
        System.out.println("you? Onto the next line!"); // Prints text and moves cursor to next line and back to the very left
        System.out.println("Hi from the next line!");
        
    }
}
    
```
